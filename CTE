Here, I performed some CTEs to find out the average payment by the top 5 customers.

```WITH customersCTE (customer_id,
        First_name,
        Last_name,
        Country,
        City) AS
( SELECT A.customer_id,
    A.first_name,
    A.last_name,
    D.country,
    C.city
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE country IN ("India", "China", "United States", "Japan", "Mexico", "Brazil",
                  "Russian Federation", "Philippines", "Turkey", "Indonesia")
AND city IN ("Aurora", "Acua", "Citrus Heights", "Iwaki", "Ambattur", "Shanwei",
             "So Leopoldo", "Teboksary", "Tianjin", "Cianjur")),
top_fiveCTE (customer_id, total_payment) AS
(SELECT customersCTE.customer_id,
    customersCTE.country,
    customersCTE.city,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customersCTE
INNER JOIN payment P on P.customer_id = customersCTE.customer_id
GROUP BY customersCTE.customer_id, customersCTE.country, customerCTE.city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(top_fiveCTE.total_amount_paid) AS average_payment
FROM top_fiveCTE;```


And here I used a CTE to find the amount of top 5 customers living in the top 10 countries.

```WITH customersCTE (customer_id,
        First_name,
        Last_name,
        Country,
        City) AS
( SELECT A.customer_id,
    A.first_name,
    A.last_name,
    D.country,
    C.city
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE country IN ("India", "China", "United States", "Japan", "Mexico", "Brazil",
                  "Russian Federation", "Philippines", "Turkey", "Indonesia")
AND city IN ("Aurora", "Acua", "Citrus Heights", "Iwaki", "Ambattur", "Shanwei",
             "So Leopoldo", "Teboksary", "Tianjin", "Cianjur")),
top_fiveCTE (customer_id, country, total_payment) AS
(SELECT customersCTE.customer_id,
    customersCTE.country,
    customersCTE.city,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customersCTE
INNER JOIN payment P on P.customer_id = customersCTE.customer_id
GROUP BY customersCTE.customer_id, customersCTE.country, customerCTE.city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT customersCTE.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customersCTE.customer_id) AS all_customer_count
    COUNT(DISTINCT top_fiveCTE.customer_id) AS top_five_count
FROM customersCTE
LEFT JOIN top_fiveCTE ON top_fiveCTE.country = customersCTE.country
GROUP BY customersCTE.country
ORDER BY top_five_count DESC;```
