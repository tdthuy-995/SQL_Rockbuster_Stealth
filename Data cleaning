In this file, I checked the film table for dirty data and summarized it afterwards.

# checking for duplicates
SELECT *,
  COUNT(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id,
  title,
  description,
  release_year,
  language_id,
  rental_duration,
  rental_rate,
  length,
  replacement_cost,
  rating,
  last_update,
  special_features,
  fulltext
HAVING COUNT (*)>1;
